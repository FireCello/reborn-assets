# 3kh0 Reborn Assets
Welcome to the repo! 
`3kh0 Reborn`'s Assets are updated un-frequently on a tri-weekly basis if any requests are in.
Games are added on a request-basis, and I do not go scavaging for games. 
## How to request games
~~I'll find them for you~~
I **DO NOT** find games for you.
You have to find them yourself. 
The community is open to adding games, and this repo contains a GNU GPLv3.0 license.
### What's a GNU GPLv3.0 license?
A GNU GPLv3.0 license allows you to: Use this project for commercial use.
Though this is a GNU GPLv3.0 license, if you paid for access to this site, you have gotten scammed.
It also allows you to distribute the repo. So feel free to fork this repo if this got blocked at your school!
